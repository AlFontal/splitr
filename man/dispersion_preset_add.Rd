\arguments{
\item{type}{the type of preset to add. The three types are "emissions", "grids", and "species". Only a single type can be specified. Once specified, the function interactively asks for input on the parameters specific to each preset.}

\item{interactive}{determines whether the function should run in an interactive mode, prompting the for input on which kinds of values to supply for each parameter.}

\item{species_name}{a case sensitive name that identifies the species preset. The use of a name is useful since presets can be referenced by this name when using the 'dispersion_preset_list' function.}

\item{particle_pdiam}{the particle diameter in units of Âµm.}

\item{particle_density}{the particle density in units of g/cm3.}

\item{particle_shape_factor}{the particle shape factor as a value between 0-1.}

\item{ddep_velocity}{the dry deposition velocity in units of m/s.}

\item{ddep_MW}{the molecular weight in units of g/mol.}

\item{ddep_A_ratio}{the dry deposition A ratio.}

\item{ddep_D_ratio}{the dry deposition D ratio.}

\item{ddep_Henrys_Law_coeff}{the Henry's Law value associated with dry deposition.}

\item{wdep_Henrys_Law_coeff}{the Henry's Law value associated with wet deposition.}

\item{wdep_in_cloud_dep}{the in-cloud wet deposition rate in units of L/L.}

\item{wdep_below_cloud_dep}{the below cloud wet deposition rate in units of 1/s.}

\item{rad_decay}{the rate of radioactive decay, in units of days.}

\item{pollutant_resuspension_factor}{the pollutant resuspension factor in units of 1/m.}

\item{emissions_name}{a case sensitive name that identifies the emissions preset. The use of a name is useful since presets can be referenced by this name when using the 'dispersion_preset_list' function.}

\item{emissions_rate}{the rate of emissions for the pollutant in mass units per hour.}

\item{emissions_duration}{the duration of emissions in hours.}

\item{emissions_start_time}{a string specifying the start of emissions in the format "YY MM DD HH MM".}

\item{grid_name}{a case sensitive name that identifies the grid preset. The use of a name is useful since presets can be referenced by this name when using the 'dispersion_preset_list' function.}

\item{grid_center}{the center of the grid, specified in a string containing latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.}

\item{grid_spacing}{the spacing between adjacent grid points, specified in a string containing decimal degree units of latitude and longitude.}

\item{grid_span}{the span of the grid, specified in a string containing decimal degree units of latitude and longitude.}

\item{grid_folder}{the location for which the grid output files will be written.}

\item{grid_filename}{the name of the output grid file for each dispersion model run. This is normally given a self-describing name, based on parameters for the model run.}

\item{grid_number_vertical}{the number of vertical levels for the grid.}

\item{grid_heights}{the heights assigned to each level, for which the total number of levels is given in the 'grid_number_vertical' argument.}

\item{grid_start_time}{a string specifying the start of sampling emissions by the grid. Should be provided in the format "YY MM DD HH MM".}

\item{grid_end_time}{a string specifying the end of sampling emissions by the grid. Should be provided in the format "YY MM DD HH MM".}

\item{sampling_interval_type_rate}{a sting that specifies the type of sampling, and the rate by which sampling occurs ("HH MM").}

\item{path_wd}{a full path should be provided for the HYSPLIT working directory since presets will reside in this folder.}

\description{
The function allows for the setting of presets specific to dispersion runs. Presets are effectively blocks of parameters that are stored on the disk. Having presets is useful because these groups of parameters can be called in different dispersion runs (and across projects) without having to specify dozens of parameters with every type of run. Furthermore, dispersion runs can utilize multiple presets of each type simply by calling the identifier for each preset (e.g., multiple predefined emissions locations can be added to a run or series of runs with a numeric vector). The presets are divided into three groups: 'emissions', 'grids', and 'species'. Each preset has a plaintext file that resides on disk of the same name (located in the SplitR folder). For removing presets from the associated files, the interactive function 'dispersion_preset_delete' can be used.
